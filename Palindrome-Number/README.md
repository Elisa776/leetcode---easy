# Palindrome Number

## Problem Description
Given an integer `x`, determine whether it is a palindrome.  
An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.  

## Example
Input: 121  
Output: true  

Input: -121  
Output: false  
(Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-.)

Input: 10  
Output: false  

## Approach
- Reverse the integer number.
- Compare the reversed number with the original number.
- If both are equal, then the number is a palindrome, otherwise not.
